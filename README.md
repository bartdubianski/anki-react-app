# Anki React App
Anki is a japanese word (暗記) for memorization. This project is my first ReactJS app which is build by me from scratch. The app concept is based on a free and open-source flashcard program using spaced repetition https://github.com/ankitects/anki.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Technology I chose for this project:
- React Router
- Bootstrap (React)
- Sass
- Google Firebase - Realtime Database
